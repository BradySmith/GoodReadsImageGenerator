GoodReadsImageGenerator
========================

## Introduction ##

Generates an image which is made up of all the recently like quotes by [GoodReads's users](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/recently_added?page=1) that can then be used a desktop background.

This code is dependent on a previous project I created [GoodReadsQuoteGrabber](https://github.com/BradySmith/GoodReadsQuoteGrabber/).

## Usage ##

Currently all the editable values are hardcoded and there is no interface. The sections which should be modified have been marked by comments

## Ideas for Future Improvements ##

- Add Interface
- Add variations for color schemes
- Have an option to print quotes in unique sizes and orientations
- Have an option to automatically detect desktop size and create a wallpaper sized image
- Have a scheduling option to automatically create a new image according to a set interval
